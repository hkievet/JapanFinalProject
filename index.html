      <h1>Introduction: Japanese Aesthetics</h1>
      <p>I was fortunate to be able to travel to Japan from December 27 2015 to January 17th 2016.  In Japan, I studied with 13 other students from the University of Minnesota studying Ritual and Resillience.  While I could write about the food, the people, the transportation system, the shopping, the dogs, the history... I'm going to write about Japanese aesthetics, specifically the prominent characteristic <i>wabi sabi</i>.</p>
      <p>Two excursions that my class participated in (in the same day) were <i>zen meditation</i> with an authentic-born-in-a-temple monk and a <i>tea ceremony</i> with an authentic tea master who had practiced the art of the tea ceremony for many generations.  Both of these activities encompassed the idea of wabi-sabi-- meditiation being philisophical and the tea ceremony being aesthetic.</p>
      <h2>Zen Meditation</h2>
      <p>In Kyoto, we went to a temple and were taught how to meditate by a monk that was born in the same temple.  The meditation 'class' included an introduction how-to explanation, followed by two 15-minute sessions, and ended with a QA.  It was not my first time attempting to achieve meditation.  Both of the sessions ended with me having numb feet from me maintaining lotus leg posture, essentially cutting blood flow off from my long legs.  The monk guided the session by smacking wood blocks together and ringing a high-pitched triangle that rang out tranquilly following the abrupt <i>clank</i> of the wood block.  Then the monk proceeded to stomp accross the tatami mats in a very uniform pattern.  I found this testing during an exercise of not trying to think about anything.</p>
      <p>The most intersesting thing was having my sensei translate the elder monk's comments regarding happiness and overcoming fear about inevitable suffering-- a very Buddhist ideal.  The monk explained that we (as humans) should be <i>content</i> with any situation we are faced with be it sickness, or death of a loved one, or starvation, or during finals week of school-- that we should accept things the way they are.  Of course, accepting things we cannot change makes sense towards the pursuit of ultimate happiness.</p>
      <h2>The Tea Ceremony</h2>
      <p>I was the lucky one in my class that was assigned to research the characteristics of a Japanese Tea Ceremony.  In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT69ANFLm2k">this documentary</a>, the narrator explains the meaning behind the traditional two-tatimi-mat sized tea house.  He compares large spaces to small spaces and concludes that large spaces grow small, while small spaces grow tremendously.  I find great truth in that wisdom.</p>
      <p>The tea ceremony was such an extraordinary yet simple event.  The room was larger than the traditional two-tatami-mat size, but it had the essential elements including the simple alcove containing a scroll with a poem written and flower that both related back to the current season.  Two very simple things with powerful meanign behind them.</p>
      <p>We were given a decadent desert to eat prior to drinking the bitter matcha tea.  I am a tea drinker and enjoy the taste, so I appreciated the thought behind bringing out the taste even further.</p>
